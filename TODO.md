# Status and TODO

## Bugs

Everything is buggy. You are lucky if it worked with your code.

## Currently supported:
- `if` condition
- `while` loop
- `for` loop only when iterating over `range()` in incrementing order
- `int`/`long` as return and argument type only
- some arithmetic and boolean operators
- only variables with explicitly given types (`a: int = 7`)

## Todo:
- argument type mapping and support
- `array`/`list` support
- `string` support
- pythonic loop control `else:`
- missing arithmetic, bitwise, logical operators
- python functions like:
 - `min()`
 - `max()`
 - `abs()`
 - `sum()`
 - `all()`
 - `any()`
- python list expressions `[x for x in ...]`
- classes and methods
- ability to select compiler, flags etc
